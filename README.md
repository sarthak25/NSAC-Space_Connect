### a) Virtual Solar System

We made a web app that allows one to navigate through space in your browser. It uses three.js to render astronomical bodies.It gives one option to either fly from one planet to another or looks for a planet and observes it or to find its orbit and track its movement. We have rendered and made 3D models of all planets in our solar system.

### b) Satellite Image Simulation

We have made a web based GUI to access images and travel through a planet using a simulation created from images that could be used for route identification, research purpose. One can Travel Through out the planet using this on their smart phones and laptops

### c) Life Identification using Satellite Images

We are using ML and web scraping to use satellite images of earth and train an ML model to detect plants and water in those photos. This model could be used to detect water and plants on other planets using Images captured by satellites 

### d) Quantum Encryption and its Simulations

We have successfully completed two quantum encryption protocols simulations and their implementation in python. The reason we insist upon quantum encryption over the modern-day hashing is that it uses spins in addition to existing binary encryption also to hack it one needs to travel back in time.

### Usability

It could be used by scientist to study the outer space in real time track activities of satellites, planets, stars on their smart phones. It can be used for tracking satellites position and its route location and using Ai based tech to identify destinations and real time navigation. It can also be used by students interested in space exploration to visualize planets and stars
